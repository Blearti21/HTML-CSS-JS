        <h1>Car </h1>
        <p>A car, or an automobile, is a motor vehicle with wheels. Most definitions of cars state that they run primarily on roads, seat one to eight people, have four wheels, 
            and mainly transport people over cargo.[1][2] There are around one billion cars in use worldwide.The French inventor Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot built the first steam-powered
            road vehicle in 1769, while the Swiss inventor François Isaac de Rivaz designed and constructed the first internal combustion-powered automobile in 1808. The modern car—a
            practical, marketable automobile for everyday use—was invented in 1886, when the German inventor Carl Benz patented his Benz Patent-Motorwagen.
            Commercial cars became widely available during the 20th century. The 1901 Oldsmobile Curved Dash and the 1908 Ford Model T, both American cars, are widely considered the 
            first mass-produced[3][4] and mass-affordable[5][6][7] cars, respectively. Cars were rapidly adopted in the US, where they replaced horse-drawn carriages.[8] In Europe
            and other parts of the world, demand for automobiles did not increase until after World War II.[9] In the 21st century, car usage is still increasing rapidly, especially
            in China, India, and other newly industrialised countries.[10][11].Cars have controls for driving, parking, passenger comfort, and a variety of lamps. Over the decades,
            additional features and controls have been added to vehicles, making them progressively more complex. These include rear-reversing cameras, air conditioning,
            navigation systems, and in-car entertainment. Most cars in use in the early 2020s are propelled by an internal combustion engine, fueled by the combustion of 
            fossil fuels. Electric cars, which were invented early in the history of the car, became commercially available in the 2000s and are predicted to cost less to buy 
            than petrol-driven cars before 2025.[12][13] The transition from fossil fuel-powered cars to electric cars features prominently in most climate change mitigation 
            scenarios,[14] such as Project Drawdown's 100 actionable solutions for climate change.</p>
